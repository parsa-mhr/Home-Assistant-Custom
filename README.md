# Home-Assistant-Custom
 This is a Customized version of HomeAssistant Core version 
    this version includes some changes in front-end and some easier access to change some things
    for change any part of project on this Image  you just need to fork or clone the source from official repo of this project 
    then make your changes and build your new source files 
    then copy your built files into right directory in the container then :
    1. you can relaunch the containers (including your changes) by docker-compose
    2. you can remake a new image after you changed the container and have another custom Image for yourself

# !!!!
    With all due respect to home assistant team for this amazing program this repo and package is just for testing changes on the project and the most focus was on changing front-end
    this is because the project is not good with changes from outside in default and I just tried to make it easier
